# Zaktak's Restrictions
Gmod Addon for servers to restrict Q menu, prop spawning, PAC3.

### A Simple Addon that lets you restrict players on your server.**
> *This is very useful in RP servers, limiting players and blocking minges.*

To configurate the addon simply edit the file called **"sh_zkrconfig.lua"** - *it is very simple.*
If you'd like to add/change further things hop in to the other files. But, you will lose any support from me as I simply cannot look
around your files trying to find your errors.
